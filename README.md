# Virtual Cricket Game
 I have created this virtual cricket game using only cpp and no css html is used. It is just basic cpp implementation using almost every important concept of cpp. I have created three library files namely team.h, game.h, player.h and a main file where I have called every function needed for the game. The code is quite easy to understand.
